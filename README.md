## Welcome to my blog

Here is yxzoe, an undergraduate student from SCU/ art person/ cat fancier. Getting myself into baking these days, maybe I'll share some compositions 

This is my first website and I love it a lot. I regard it as my new-born baby and I'm looking forward to bringing it grow into a powerful website. You can [click here](http://www.yxzoe.github.io/) to enter my blog.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yxzoe/yxzoe.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
